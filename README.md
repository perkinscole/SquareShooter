#Square Shooter
This is a little game I made while bored during quarantine. You and a colleague try and survive 10 rounds against a horde. What I thought would be interesting, or why I made it is the primary mechanic, which is that firing a projetile creates recoil and thats how you actually move around. It was pretty fun to play with my brother for a little bit but nothing groundbreaking.
